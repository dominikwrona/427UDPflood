# 427 UDP Flood Lab
Use UDP.c for Linux, UDP_MacOS for Mac. (Windows untested).

1) Fill in the 5 To-Do's in the file so it compiles and works properly. 

2) Launch an attack against victim's IP address (e.g. install an Apache server or otherwise make sure the ports you target are open)

3) Launch Wireshark on victim's computer to see the incoming UDP packets

4) Submit Wireshark screenshot (including UDP target port) and the UDP flood completed code.
